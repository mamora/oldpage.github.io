<p> I am a scientist born in Ecuador. Right now I am working in microbial genetics at <a href="http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~redfield/whoMMora.html"> Redfield lab </a> in University of British Columbia as a PhD student.</p>
<p> My scientific interest are broad from Microbiology, Population Genetics to Ecology and Evolution.</p>

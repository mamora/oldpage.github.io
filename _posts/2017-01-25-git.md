# Git commands


In this blog post will be my first git cheat sheet in order to learn git better.

This assumes you already have a local git repository in your computer

This post is based on this video [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpUDlhh8I2E)

## Commands

1. *git  init*  --> link a folder as a repository in github

2. *git status*  --> tells your the status of your folder e.g. which changes have been made, if you are in the master branch, etc.

3. *git add filename*  --> add file to staging area (see the video to understand what stagging area is)

4. *git commit* --> commit or save changes from stagging area to master branch. Note: this command will send you to VIM page. Write the commit message and then press : and in the cursor that appear press x.

5. *git config --global core.editor "nano -w"* --> changes the text editor to nano (so VIM won't appear again)

6. *git commit -m "write message"* --> commit writting message directly. *Note* remember before commit add  file to stagging area 

7. *git log* --> reverse chronological list of all messages you made

      + --oneline --> gives one first digits of each message code

8. *git dif* --> differences between two changed versions of a file. Gives first changed version and then current version.     

     + sometimes when files in stagging area have been changed, diff alone won't show changes. Use diff --staged in that case 

9. *git add .* --> changed all files that were changed
